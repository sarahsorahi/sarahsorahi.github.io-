### Project 1 — Word Function Classification
*2024- 2026
I work on **data augmentation, clustering, and model training** to identify the function of a word in sentence context. The project focuses on improving robustness when annotated data is limited and on understanding functional variation through contextual patterns.  
In collaboration with Kevin Tang.
