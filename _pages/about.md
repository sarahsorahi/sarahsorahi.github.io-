I work on NLP- and data-driven projects, with a focus on organizing workflows, coordinating teams, and turning technical work into usable outcomes.
I am currently finalizing my master’s thesis on word embeddings and syncretism, where I work with data pipelines and NLP models to study how meaning and ambiguity are represented in vector-based systems. This work has given me hands-on experience with data engineering tasks, modeling workflows, and project-oriented research.
Alongside this, I coordinate data- and AI-related projects in an international professional environment, managing communication across teams, structuring project processes, and supporting the integration of AI solutions to improve efficiency and user experience.
I am looking for roles where data, AI, and project coordination come together — especially positions that value clear communication between technical teams and stakeholders.
