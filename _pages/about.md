<div style="max-width:820px; margin-top:2rem; font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.75; font-family: 'Georgia', 'Times New Roman', serif;">

<p>
I have a background in linguistics and a strong interest in its applications in technology, particularly in computational linguistics, natural language processing, and deep learning. I am especially curious about how language, data, and artificial intelligence interact, and how linguistic insight can improve computational models.
</p>

<p style="margin-top:1.8rem;">
I am currently an MA student in Linguistics, writing my master’s thesis on <em>syncretism in word embeddings</em>, where I explore how meaning and ambiguity are represented in vector spaces. Alongside my studies, I work as a research assistant, teaching assistant, and tutor, supporting linguistics courses and students.

In parallel, I work in a modern bridal company managing data- and AI-related projects within cross-cultural collaborations. My role involves coordinating project workflows and supporting the integration of AI-driven solutions to improve efficiency and user engagement.
</p>

<p style="margin-top:1.8rem; font-style:italic; color:#374151;">
Overall, I enjoy working at the intersection of language, technology, and real-world problem solving, and I’m motivated by projects that connect analytical thinking with human-centered design.
