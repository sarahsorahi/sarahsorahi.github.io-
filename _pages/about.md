## About Me

<div style="max-width:900px; margin:0 auto;">

<p style="font-size:1.05rem; line-height:1.8;">
I have a background in linguistics and a strong interest in its applications in technology, particularly in <span style="color:#3b6ea5;">computational linguistics</span>, <span style="color:#3b6ea5;">natural language processing</span>, and <span style="color:#3b6ea5;">deep learning</span>. I am especially curious about how language, data, and artificial intelligence interact, and how linguistic insight can improve computational models.

<p style="font-size:1.05rem; line-height:1.8;">
I am currently an <strong>MA student in Linguistics</strong>, writing my master’s thesis on <span style="color:#7c3aed;">syncretism in word embeddings</span>, where I explore how meaning and ambiguity are represented in vector spaces. Alongside my studies, I work as a <strong>research assistant</strong>, <strong>teaching assistant</strong>, and <strong>tutor</strong>, supporting linguistics courses and students.

In parallel, I work in a modern bridal company managing <span style="color:#059669;">data- and AI-related projects</span> within cross-cultural collaborations. My role involves coordinating and organizing project workflows, and supporting the integration of AI-driven solutions to improve efficiency and user engagement.

<p style="font-size:1.05rem; line-height:1.8; font-style:italic; color:#374151;">
Overall, I enjoy working at the intersection of language, technology, and real-world problem solving, and I’m motivated by projects that connect analytical thinking with human-centered design.
