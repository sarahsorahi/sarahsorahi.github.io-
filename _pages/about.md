I work on NLP- and data-driven projects, with a focus on organizing workflows, coordinating teams, and turning technical work into usable outcomes.
I am currently finalizing my master’s thesis on word embeddings and syncretism, where I work with data pipelines and NLP models to study how meaning and ambiguity are represented in vector-based systems. This work has given me hands-on experience with data engineering tasks, modeling workflows, and project-oriented research.

At university, I am finalizing my master’s thesis on word embeddings and syncretism, where I work with NLP models and data pipelines to explore how meaning and ambiguity are represented in vector spaces.

Alongside my academic work, I am part of a startup, where I am involved in coordinating projects, managing international communication, and supporting data and AI-informed solutions in everyday workflows. Working in this environment has shaped how I think about structure, clarity, and collaboration in real settings.
